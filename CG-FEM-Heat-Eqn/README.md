This repo contains a 1-dimensional finite element analysis of the partial differential heat equation. The Continuous Galerkin finite element method with Langrangian basis functions was used approximate this PDE. This specific problem uses N = 11 Nodes, however the code will run if N is changed. Gaussian Quadrature was used to numerically integrate the weak form of the external forcing equation f(x,t). The mass and stiffness matrices were calculated by hand mapping from the x to the xi-space and programmed into the code. This stiffness matrix is the same for any problem on a uniform mesh. The forward/backward Euler equations use a reduced form these matrices due to boundary conditions.
